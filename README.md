Inspired from Wordle app to built with additional options -

▪️Generate a game with your customized word and challenge with others.

▪️More than one word a day to play as many as you like.

▪️PWA support to install as a standalone android like app.

▪️Native web share API to share customized game share link and scores as emoji with trend. 

▪️Server side validation, unlike the original one with client side solution visible in local storage.
